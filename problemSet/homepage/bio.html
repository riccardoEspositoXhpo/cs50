                <p>I was born almost 30 years ago in a small italian town called Monfalcone, in the north-east of Italy.</p>
                <p>I attended the university of Trieste for a Bachelor's degree in Economics of Financial Markets and Institutions,
                and then moved to Milan to complete my master's degree in Quantitative Finance.</p>
                <p>After that, I got a job offer and moved to London for my first job in Finance. Turns out the job was more in Fintech than Finance,
                and I was able to get acquainted again with my love for technology.</p>
                <p>After 4 years in London, I decided that a change was needed and I moved to ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. In the summer of 2021 I finally decided
                to follow my passion for computer science and enrolled in CS50x. This brings us back to today, and it is the reason you are seeing this webpage.</p>
