Lesson 0 - Representation:

Counting in binary is done in base 2 notation.
Ex: number 50 is represented binary

1 1 00 1 0
32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0

---

ASCII is just a decode between bits and letters/symbols.
Ex: 33 is "H".

ASCII used 8 bits, giving total of 256 characters. Extremely limiting.

----

Unicode can support 8,16,32 bits and can support characters in any language, including emokis.

----

RGB is the 0-255 (red,green,blue) with which computers represent colors

this is how we represent pictures.
To represent video, we just change the pixel rapidly.
(fps)

----

All these systems are designed to convert bits into usable information.
This is why file formats exist.
